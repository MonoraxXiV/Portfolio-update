        <h3>highlights</h3>
        <p>These projects are more special to me, either due to the complexity or due to the fact that they just

                <h3>Sirohcco</h3>
                <p>A project made in React, learned a lot about passing props, values and the reading of code in
                    React.</p>
                <p> In this project I helped with the front end, checking where edits are needed, making edits on
                    visuals, designing of the cards, animated toggle buttons.</p>
                <p>Loading can take a bit if you have a big steam library.</p>

                <br>
                <p> Sirrohco is a colaboration, made by using the steam API, a not so beginner friendly API. Sicco, the owner of the repository made a lot of the back end and the authentication on top of managing the api calls and promises.
                Xander helped with the back end as well, and Nikita worked on a big part of the filters.</p>

        <p>These projects are made in CSS, often combined with bootstrap or tailwind.<br>
            Tailwind I learned in self study, because I liked how it seemed to be a step between CSS and bootstrap.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>These projects were made in Javascript, my favourite one was the pokedex. <br>
            The API is very well documented and it makes learning how to use an API much more easy.</p>

                day, but way more extravagant.

            <li> Remaking the pokedex in php shortly after the JavaScript one, it was an interesting way to be
