# Portfolio-update

This reposity is made by MonoraxXiV, it's a portfolio site that showcases my projects.  
    It will feature several things: e.g. What I am currently working on, which languages or frameeworks I am currently learning  
    I hope it will convey the process of my growth.  
    This is a work in progress at this moment. The three projected pages will be a landing page, a contact page and a page featuring projects.
    
To see this site you can either press the link on the reposity or clone it and run it locally.
