# Portfolio-update

This reposity is made by MonoraxXiV, it's a portfolio site that showcases my projects.  
    It will feature several things: e.g. What I am currently working on, which languages or frameworks I am currently learning  
    I hope it will convey the process of my growth.  
This is a 90% finished work in progress, in the future will add a part for React projects as well as more highlights under the page of projects.
    
To see this site you can either press the link on the repository or clone it and run it locally. 

### Deployed
